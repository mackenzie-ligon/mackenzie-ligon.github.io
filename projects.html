          Role: Backend Developer
          <ul class="cardlist">
            <li>Blueboard is an online quiz distribution platform that serves both students and professors. Different functions are available depending on the type of account.</li>
            <li>Professors can create courses, create and edit quizzes for each course, create announcements for courses, and grade student quiz submissions. Certain quiz questions can be set to be autograded.</li>
            <li>Studets can enroll in courses using the provided registration code, view professor annoucements and created quizzes along with their deadlines, take the quizzes and see all of their grades.</li>
            <li>I worked on the backend of the site, managing the server queries to the database and handling the deployment of our site. I used PostgreSQL to query the database to insert and retrieve account information, faciliate account enrollment into courses, and store and retrieve quiz objects. The site is deployed using Fly.io's services.</li>

          Role: Game Programmer
          <ul class="cardlist">
            <li>Our team was given a week and a half to create a GDD and MVP based on information provided in class.</li>
            <li>I was the sole programmer on the team. My other group members were Animation majors, and they worked on the visuals of the game. Everything is coded in Unity.</li>
            <li>The game mechanics are simple, but our goal was to create a game that's easy to learn and is fun for hours!</li>
            <li>I did not have much time to do extensive testing, so there might be some bugs I don't know about. Sorry! However, I might add new features over time. Latest updates will be under the tutorial.</li>

          <h3 class="sub-header">Fool's Gambit - MVP Project</h3>
          Role: Backend Developer, Artist
          <ul class="cardlist">
            <li>Our team was tasked with creating an MVP utilizing the Agile Development Method. We used a Kanban board to keep track of our tasks, participated in weekly stand-up meetings, and presented our progress at Sprint Reviews at the end of each three week sprint.</li>
            <li>We decided to make a chess inspired tower defense game, where the chess pieces are the towers, and move according to standard chess piece movement.</li>
            <li>This game is inspired by Bloons Tower Defense, but key differences are that pieces can be repositioned after landing a certain amount of hits, and the track enemies travel on will change every 8 levels.</li>
            <li>I was responsible for level design, manually coding all 50 levels, as well as coding all enemy variations and enemy buff effects. I also hand drew all of the sprites for the pieces (including tower upgrade sprites and enemy buff sprites).</li>
